This repository contains my project submissions for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), a comprehensive web development curriculum. Each folder showcases different projects and exercises that cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **HTML & CSS**: Building responsive web layouts and mastering fundamental web design principles.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing interactive features, DOM manipulation, and algorithms.
